/* This program takes a single argument that is a path to a directory.
 * The program stores the contents of the directory in an array, calls
 * qsort to sort them in descending alphabetical order (from z to a) and
 * then prints the array.

 * Most of the code is given for you.  You are asked to complete a few sections.
 * The purpose of this exercise is to give you some practice with function
 * pointers, and some practice using readdir.  You will probably need to read
 * the man page for qsort and the man page for readdir to complete this
 * program.

 * A Makefile and a test directory have been provided for you as an example
 * of how you might test your program.
