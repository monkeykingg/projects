# Assignment 1
Due Date: October 6

## Overview:
The goal of this assignment is to learn git, research public REST APIs and get data from the APIs. We are using GitHub Classroom for purposes of setting up and marking the assignments. This assignment will be a stepping stone towards the final project of this course.

## Requirements:
- Choose a REST API and provide a project proposal
- Setup a GitHub account and clone the starter repository
- Write three functions demonstrating the use of a public API
- Submit a SOLUTIONS.md in the expected format

## Instructions:
### Choose a REST API and provide a project proposal
Select a public facing REST API. You can take a look at this comprehensive list of APIS here (https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis). Please use an API **not** requiring OAuth authentication.

Your project proposal should be a 2-3 lines description of how you plan on using the selected API in building a web application. You should also describe why your API qualifies as RESTful.

### Setup a GitHub account and clone the starter repository

The Assignment sits here: https://classroom.github.com/g/oIBwNf7U. Use the following instructions:
- Click on the link above
- Sign into GitHub or create a new account
- As this is a group assignment, you and your teammates will be joining the same group. Sync up with one another to come up with a cool name (extra brownie points up for grabs). One teammate will create the team, and every other teammate must join the team.
- Github classroom will clone the starter repository for this assignment. (Note: This may take 5-10 seconds).
- You will now have access to a repository called FallCSC309/assignment-1-team-(team-name)
- Clone this repository on a local machine. (https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)
- Make changes to main.js and SOLUTIONS.md
- Once you are done with your changes, push them to the remote repository (https://help.github.com/articles/pushing-to-a-remote/). 
- The last commit before the deadline will be used to mark the assignment.



### Write three functions demonstrating the use of a public API
In this assignment, you need to implement 3 Javascript functions in main.js play with the public API you choose. There would be 3 functions in main.js to implement.

- getListsOfItems: Find a RESTFUL API and use GET to retrive a list of items.
- getOneItemById: Retrieve a single item by id based on the list you get from GET.
- getOneAttributeFromItem: Return any attribute from the retrieved item. 

### Submit a SOLUTIONS.md in the expected format
Edit the SOLUTIONS.md to add your names and student IDs. You will also include the project description here.

## Resources and Tips
- A very good Git tutorial sits here: https://try.github.io/
- If you and your team are making simultaneous changes to this repository, it is recommended that you use branches.
- If you run into any problems, post it on Piazza and add the tag project to it.
