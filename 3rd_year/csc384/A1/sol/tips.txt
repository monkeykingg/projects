1. Try to move big snowball first than other snowballs, second is the medium one.
   Because big snowball should be the first one at destination, then the medium
   one.

2. Record coordinates at the UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT sides of snowballs.
   Coordinates can help you to check if snowballs' position leads to no
   solutions, like snowballs at corner.

3. If destination at corner, then only if snowballs not stick to edges or
   stick to the same edges as destinationâ€™s edges can continue moving robot.
   Otherwise lead to no solution.

4. If there is a snowman is formed by placing a small snowball atop a medium one
   on the game board, then these situations should be considered as no solution case.
   Same as a snowman is formed by placing a small snowball atop a big one.

5. If there is a complete snowman or a snowman formed by placing a medium snowball
   atop a big one, then it have to be at destination.
   Otherwise this situation leads to no solution.
