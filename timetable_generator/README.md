For users: You can just run test_cases.py to see the test cases we prepared for demo.
           If you want to see other cases we prepared, you can change or add coure list into board.
           If you want to test more cases, please initiate new Course type variable in test_cases.py, then add them into
           new course list your created, finally, add the new course list into board.
           If you want to see result with different ordering heuristics, you should change test_mrv or test_random or
           test_dh (only one of these three can be True, others should set to False), they are located at the top of
           test_cases.py.
