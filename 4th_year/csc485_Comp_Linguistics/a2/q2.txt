a).
	There are 8 trees.


b).
	1). NP -> NP PP | Det N
	This causes a non-stop loop and produces infinite NP branches.
	This formula is infinitely recursive.

	2). NP -> Det N | NP PP
	This solves the infinite loop.
	This formula ends the NP loop when the parser finds a noun follows a determiner.
	However, this does not work in general since we cannot guarantee that a noun will always follow a determiner.
	If there is a noun without the determiner in the sentence, it will reach NP -> NP PP, then the rd parser will loop infinitely again.
