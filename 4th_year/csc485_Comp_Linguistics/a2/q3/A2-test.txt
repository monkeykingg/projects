Nadia left immediately
the cat with the long soft fur slowly ate
she arrived

Nadia with the long soft fur slowly ate
the cat with the tall her arrived

Nadia will leave
Nadia has left
Nadia may have been leaving

Nadia will left
Nadia has could leave
Nadia has had left

Nadia fondled the eggplant
the handsome poodle brought Ross to the autoclave
Nadia brought a cloth for the cheese
they told her to jump onto the elephant
she believed that Ross was already on the hovercraft
she really wanted help
she really aspired to help
cheese was always on the menu
the eggplant reminded Nadia of Ross

Nadia found
Ross brought to him
they told to jump onto the elephant

Nadia rewarded the man with the eggplant

Nadia won an elephant
a rutabaga could have been demanded
autopoiesis always reminded her of Marseilles

I saw Nadia on a boat with my elephant
Nadia was reminded
an elephant had been being won
